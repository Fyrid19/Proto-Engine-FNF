# !! DISCONTINUED !! (well, not really)
After a bit of thought, I've decided that trying to edit legacy FNF's source code to form it into my own thing is, well, a bad idea.

To sum it up, Prototype Engine is getting a complete rewrite. I honestly think this decision is for the better, but I'm not gonna keep talking like this is some highly anticipated project.

See you in the rewrite.
